      <h1>" You should keep a symptom journal... "</h1>
      <p>You probably heard this from someone when you were first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis&mdash;or maybe even before a doctor officially delivered this news. I certainly read this more than once, and it's good advice.</p>
      <p>At first, when I was having lots of symptoms, it was really helpful to track what was going on every day. But once that relapse was over, I struggled. Every tingle or twinge made me think about whether it was worth writing down.</p>
      <p>Now that I've lived with an MS diagnosis for almost 10 years, I've come to see that there are at least three ways I think about my life with MS. </p>
